# Sorting Hat

## Project Overview
The Hogwarts Virtual Sorting Hat is a modern solution to that age-old question:

"What kind of kid is that?"

## Deployed Project
Current version is live at https://berka-sorting-hat.netlify.app

## Target Audience and Addressed Concerns
Hogwarts administration has grown weary of their cranky ol' hat. We have built a quicker, quieter, and less lousy (no more nitpicking) alternative, with the added benefit of managing first year rosters and relegating the ill-equipped to Azakaban (probably). 

## Features
- Hassle-free, single-click, abstracted sorting method for first-years (except for the Weasleys, they know where they belong)
- One-touch visual expulsion (unfortunately, there's still some paperwork to make it official)
- Options to change display to filter by house, and show/hide the Sorting Hat and Baddies List
- Mobile accessible
